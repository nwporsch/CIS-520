---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

Firstly we copy the entire filename and arguments using palloc to avoid a race condition between the caller and load(). Then we malloc the filename and all parameters, copy it to memory with strlcpy, and tokenize the filename and the parameters using strtoken_r to separate them. Then we create the new thread and execute it with just the file name as the first argument and the entire filename as the last.

We map a zero page at the top of virtual memory and check to see if the page we actually want is less than PHYS_BASE,
this prevents us from overflowing the stack page. If that passes we tokenize the filename and the parameters in order to separate them with strtok_r and then loop through the tokens and place them in an array in reverse order that is a copy of argv then copy that array back into argv. Now that argv has the arguments in the right order we go through and push argv, argc, and a void* return address.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

Because we need to make sure we know the size of the buffer.  strtok() can buffer overflow and access memory that it shouldn't have access to.

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into an executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

By allowing the shell to separate the arguments, it allows the kernel system code to be simpler since it can pass the job off to shell instead of doing it itself.  

Also it adds efficiency because the shell would only be handling one executable and arguments, the system has
to manage all of the running threads, and if a new process needs to be executed that is very large then the entire
system has to slow down in order to prepare the arguments and the stack.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

Whenever a new file is opened a file descriptor is created that is associated with
that file.  All file descriptors are unique within a single process, so when the 
process ends or the file is closed, the file descriptors are removed as well.  

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

Using the read method in syscall.c we pass a pointer to the file we want to read as an argument. Then we check if the
next space in memory is free, if it is we create a buffer located two spaces below the file pointer, and loop in
order to read the file by storing calls to input_getc in the buffer space. If the next space is not free, we search
through the list looking for the file in the list of all_files for the current thread. If we can't find it, then
we return -1, else we found the file and begin reading it by acquiring the filesystem lock, reading the file, 
releasing the lock and returning what was read.

Using the write method in syscall.c we pass a pointer to the file we want to write as an argument. Then we check if
the next space of memory is occupied, if it is we place a bufer in the next two spaces after that and return. If the
next space of memeory is available, we search through the list of all files, and copy the one we're looking for. If
the file can't be found we return -1, otherwise we found the file, acquire the filesystem lock, start writing the file, release the lock and return what was written.

If a full page of data is copied into the kernel then that means the data either lies
entirely in one page or overlaps into another, meaning at least one and at most two inspections
must be made to the page table (assuming the data can't be fragmented). If there is only two bytes 
then the number is the same, at least once at most twice. As long as there is more than one byte of
data, there is a chance not all of the data can fit into one full page.
The only possible way you could improve this would be to have a full page of data be the 
entireity of memory, which is clearly not a good idea.

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call

Look through the childrens list of the thread that is waiting, after we find the child that we've been waiting
on we check to see whether it or current thread is null, if not then we update the thread that we're waiting on to be the child.
Then we check if the child has been used, if not we decrement it's semaphore and return the error given by the childs exit error.

Having a file that handles exceptions and errors entirely is a good way to avoid obscuring the code, because
it separates the actual functionality from the problems that come from said functionality. The easiest way 
to ensure that the resources are free is to dump the frame associated with the process before you exit.

We use the files exception.c and exception.h for error handling and disposal of processes. The kill method
takes an interrupt frame and kills the process before dumping its virtual memory and exiting the thread.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

By adding a bool success field to the thread struct, every thread has access to whether or not a child process 
successfully executed. This status is checked whenever a thread tries to execute, start, or load, and upon a 
failure immediately sets the attribute of it's parent to false, otherwise it sets it to true.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you

>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

If P calls wait(C) before C exits, P blocks itself until C exits which will unblock P.
Once C exits, the tread and it's data is freed by P which allows it to run.  
If P calls wait(C) after C exits, C should have already updated it's status in P by 
exiting, so P should have access to C's data and be able to free it if it isn't free.
Whenever a process is killed we make sure to dump it's virtual memory space before it exits.
If P exits before C exits, P should update C's parent thread so that it points to main. If P
exits after C exits, it shouldn't have to worry about what C as it's information should have 
been dumped by C, allowing P to dump itself.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

File descriptors allow for quick and reliable searching for needed information. 

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

File descriptors can be placed in a list working them is rather simple, mapping
between the file descriptor struct and a file isn't very complex and makes the 
code more reader friendly. This helped streamline debugging somewhat. A disadvantage
with file descriptors is that if a thread has too many files open, searching the list
for the right file descriptor will slow the process down.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

We did not change the identity mapping.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

I would say this project was fairly diffcult and more time consuming compared to the other projects.
I think this project would work better if broken into smaller projects, but at the current time I do 
not know how that would be possible.

Compared to the last project, this one was far more difficult in terms of implementation and comprehension.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

Originally, I had a very basic understanding of how the stack functioned. But, during the stack's construction
I learned more of why it was used in a reverse order and learned more about memory management.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

The project was very hard to figure out where to start. When passing arguments, the description sounded like it would be fairly simple.
But, as the project continued it became more and more complicated and harder to keep track of where I needed to look for help.

Maybe if either argument passing or system calls were already implemented then the project would not have been such a pain, trying to 
build them both in tandem is like trying to build a railroad track while starting at two ends and meeting in the middle.  We had to go
back and redo both syscall.c and process.c because they weren't matching up correctly.

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

The pintos book is pretty good at helping when I already know what I am supposed to do. I think there needs to be some kind of resource that better explains different methods and describes processes more clearly.

>> Any other comments?
